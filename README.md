## Overview

Pluto is a mobile application that presents university students with a social network of the events going on at their school. These events are added to the network by the students, professors, and staff alike and the nature of these events can range from going for a jog in the morning to a popular football game on Saturday night.

Users can invite other users to events and even subscribe to the networks customized by their friends. Once a user has expressed interest in an event, he or she can add the event to their feed (also adding it to their personal calendar).
